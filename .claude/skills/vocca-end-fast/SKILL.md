# Vocca End (Fast Track)

## Overview

Closes out a unit of work's local state after the PR has merged: **master → pull → remove worktree → delete branch**. No report (use `vocca-end` / `ve` for that).

**Invocation:** `vef <type> <id>` — e.g. `vef bug 12`, `vef feat dictation-core`.

- `type` ∈ `bug | feat | feature | task | chore` (normalize `feature` → `feat`)
- `id` = the GitHub issue number, or the slug used at begin time
- Owner is `aliz`
- Branch: `<type>/<id>/aliz`; worktree dir: `.claude/worktrees/<type>-<id>`

Vocca is a single repo, so this runs once. The base branch is **`master`**, never `main`.

## Pipeline

### Phase 0 — Safety check

Before removing anything:

- **Worktree clean?** `git -C <worktree> status --porcelain` must be empty. If not, stop — commit or stash first.
- **Branch merged?** Confirm the PR is merged (`gh pr view <PR> --json state,mergedAt` if reachable). `git branch -d` will refuse an unmerged branch on purpose; do not bypass with `-D` without explicit user OK.
- **You may be inside the worktree being removed.** Resolve the primary checkout first (Phase 1) and run all commands from there.

### Phase 1 — Master, pulled

Resolve the **primary** checkout (not the worktree). The first line of `git worktree list` is the primary:

```bash
PRIMARY=$(git worktree list | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
```

Switch and pull, fast-forward only:

```bash
git -C "$PRIMARY" checkout master
git -C "$PRIMARY" pull --ff-only origin master
```

### Phase 2 — Remove worktree, delete branch

```bash
WORKTREE_NAME="<type>-<id>"   # e.g. bug-12, feat-dictation-core
BRANCH="<type>/<id>/aliz"     # e.g. bug/12/aliz, feat/dictation-core/aliz

git -C "$PRIMARY" worktree remove ".claude/worktrees/$WORKTREE_NAME"
git -C "$PRIMARY" branch -d "$BRANCH"
```

If `worktree remove` refuses due to uncommitted/untracked files, go back to Phase 0 — don't pass `--force` silently.

If `branch -d` refuses because the branch isn't merged into master, surface the message — the PR may not be merged, or there are unpushed commits. Don't use `-D` silently.

After both succeed, verify:

```bash
git -C "$PRIMARY" worktree list           # the worktree should be gone
git -C "$PRIMARY" branch --list "$BRANCH" # should print nothing
```

### Phase 3 — Release (deferred, do nothing)

**There is no release step yet.** Vocca is greenfield with no release machinery — no `RELEASING.md`, no `.github/workflows/release.yml`, no packaging manifest — so finishing a unit of work does **not** tag or publish anything. Do not create a git tag, do not `gh release create`, do not build or upload artifacts. Cleanup ends at Phase 2.

> **When Vocca later gains a macOS release pipeline** (likely a signed/notarized app distributed via GitHub Releases, possibly a Homebrew cask — **not** PyPI), add a real release phase here and update `vocca-end` to match. Until that machinery and its `RELEASING.md` exist, there is nothing to release.

### Phase 4 — Comment on the issue (optional)

Optional, and only if there's a reachable GitHub issue. Ask first: *"Want me to post a short comment on the issue explaining what we did?"* If the user declines, there's nothing meaningful to say, or there's no issue (the work came from an inline brief), skip.

Otherwise:

1. **Draft a short note** (2–4 sentences). Sources, in order of preference:
   - What the user tells you to say.
   - The merged PR's title + description (`gh pr view <PR>`), if accessible.
   - A best-effort summary from the issue title and the change verb.

   Keep it friendly, light on jargon, no em dashes, no commit hashes, no file paths. The change verb matches the type: `bug → fixed`, `task → done`, `feat`/`feature → shipped`, `chore → done`. Example: *"Shipped hold-to-talk dictation. Press the hotkey, talk, and your words type straight into whatever app you're in, cleaned up as you go. Let me know if anything looks off."*

2. **Confirm the draft** with the user before posting.

3. **Post it** via `gh`:

   ```bash
   gh issue comment "$ID" --body "<confirmed comment text>"
   ```

   On success `gh` prints the comment URL. Tell the user it landed. If `gh` errors (not authenticated, Issues disabled), surface it and stop — don't retry blindly.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Running from inside the worktree being removed | Resolve `PRIMARY` first, run commands from there |
| Checking out / pulling `main` | Vocca's base branch is `master`; `main` doesn't exist |
| Using `git pull` (allowing merge) | Use `--ff-only` |
| Forcing branch delete with `-D` | Only after explicit user OK — `-d` refuses unmerged for a reason |
| Forcing worktree remove with `--force` | Same — never silently discard uncommitted work |
| Worktree dir vs branch confusion | Worktree dir is `<type>-<id>` (e.g. `bug-12`); branch is `<type>/<id>/aliz` |
| Posting the issue comment without confirmation | Draft first, show the user, only post after explicit OK |
| Trying to comment when the work has no issue | Skip Phase 4 — it came from an inline brief |
| Tagging or publishing a release at end | There is no release machinery yet — cleanup stops at Phase 2; do not tag or publish |
| Assuming a packaging manifest / release workflow exists | Vocca is greenfield — add a release phase only once a macOS release pipeline (signed app / Homebrew cask, not PyPI) and its `RELEASING.md` land |
