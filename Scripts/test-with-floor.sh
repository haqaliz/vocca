# Runs `swift test` and fails the run unless it actually executed tests.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `swift test` exits 0 when it discovers nothing. Measured on this repository: renaming every
# `func testX` to `func checkX` — the shape of a careless refactor, not of sabotage — produces
#
#     Test Suite 'All tests' passed
#          Executed 0 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in 0.000 seconds
#     swift test EXIT=0
#
# and every CI job goes green having measured nothing. The same happens if `.testTarget` is
# dropped from Package.swift, or if a `--filter` matches nothing.
#
# That matters more here than in most repositories, because *every* gate on this project is
# delivered by `swift test`: the zero-network invariant (a permanent release blocker), the module
# boundary lint, the licence-header lint, the entitlement set-equality check, and the build
# configuration detector. Without a floor under the test count there is no floor under any of them.
#
# The floor is deliberately well below the current count and well above zero. It is a check against
# wholesale disappearance of the suite, not against removing an individual test — that is what code
# review is for, and a floor tight enough to catch it would fail on every legitimate refactor and be
# lowered within a week.
#
# Not overridable by an environment variable on purpose: a floor a caller can set to 0 is not a
# floor. Raising it as the suite grows is a deliberate edit to this line, visible in review.
#
# Usage: Scripts/test-with-floor.sh [extra swift test arguments...]
#   Environment (VOCCA_APP_BUNDLE, VOCCA_EXPECTED_CONFIGURATION, CI, ...) is inherited by
#   `swift test` unchanged, so this is a drop-in replacement for it in any context.

# Deliberate, reviewed constant — not derived from the current run (see below for why). Raised to
# 104 by task 4's first review round, which added two in SessionMachineTests: a stop arriving inside
# the microphone opening is now applied the moment the session exists rather than dropped (the
# review measured the real recovery for a dropped `.tapDisabled` as the 120 s ceiling, not the one
# poll interval the code claimed), and the bookkeeping on that same re-entrant path is pinned.
#
# It was 102 after task 4 itself, which added twenty-five: twenty-three in SessionMachineTests for
# the session state machine and its custody funnel, and two in CoreBoundaryTests — that a SessionOutcome is
# constructed in exactly one place in VoccaCore, and that the module reads no standard-library
# clock. The second of those closes a gap the import allow-list structurally cannot: ContinuousClock
# and SuspendingClock need no import, so `ContinuousClock().now` inside the session machine would
# leave the ceiling untestable with the boundary lint green.
#
# It was 77 after task 3's second review round, which added one: the dictate and converse bindings of
# PRODUCT_SPEC.md:127 must not match each other's press. Starting a session now requires an *exact*
# match on the bindable modifiers (locks masked), because superset semantics let one press match two
# configured bindings — and the direction that matters types speech meant for the agent into the
# focused field.
#
# It was 76 after the first review round, which added one: a multi-modifier chord must be matched as a
# whole and not in part. Every other test configured a hotkey with one modifier or none, and for
# those a chord predicate meaning *intersects* is indistinguishable from one meaning *contains all*
# — the suite was green at 75/75 with that defect in place.
#
# It was 75 after task 3 itself, which added twenty-three: twenty-one in SessionDecisionTests for
# the decision function, and two in CoreBoundaryTests (no mutable global state in VoccaCore, and
# the SessionOutcome source pins).
#
# It was 52 after task 2, which added sixteen: six in CoreBoundaryTests and ten in
# SessionVocabularyTests. (That one passed through 48 and 51 mid-task; review round 1 added the
# transitive re-export rule with its positive control and the autoclosure check, round 2 the
# CapturedAudio constraint.) It was 36 after the package-root-helper consolidation (task 1), and 33
# before that.
#
# Raise it by hand, in the commit that changes the count, whenever the suite grows on purpose.
